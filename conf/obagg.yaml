# When different exchanges have identical levels in their books we must choose
# the order. Setting this to true will order higher amounts closer to center
# of the orderbook. If using this aggregated orderbook to decide which exchange
# to place orders for strategies such as arbitrage or market making, I would
# set the paramter to be true, positioning larger liquidity closer to the centre
# of the book. Moreover, speed is of the essence in such strategies and the fewer
# levels we need to traverse to calculate predicted profit margins for specific
# sized orders, the better.
